# GUI-Python
GUI Python in Python, second year second semester's third Python project

Activate the *play1.py* file for question 1 and *play2.py* file for question 2.

### Question 1
A customer bank account management class.
#### Account Details
1) Customer name
2) Account number
3) Balance
4) Credit line (default: NIS 1500)
#### Account Methods
1) Deposit
2) Withdraw
3) Balance
4) Transfer
#### Extras
1) Decorator which displays for each transaction its execution date.
2) Generator that goes over all bank customers and each time returns the total balance of each customer.

### Question 2
Given a *word.txt* file containing a collection of English language words, we build a generator that accepts two parameters; a letter and a boolean variable (include, and exclude), and accordingly fetches the next word in the file.  
For example, receiving the letter e and the Exclude flag will display the words from the file that do not contain the letter e (small or large), the Include flag will display only those containing e or E. (A word does not include a period or semicolon).  
We display a frequency graph of the first 10 letters of English in the words of the file. (A small or capital letter instance is considered to be the same letter. The occurrence of a letter in a word several times is counted as the number of occurrences respectively).
